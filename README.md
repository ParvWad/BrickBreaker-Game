The goal for this project was to explore animation as well as pygame. This was done through the creation of a two player brick player game. This game ends when a player wins twice (Best 2 out of three rules).

Player 1 controls the left part of the screen using w a s d keys to direct direction. While Player 2 controls the right part of the screeen using the arrow keys to direct direction. The player must "bounce" the ball and "break" the bricks to get a score. Letting the ball fall will result in a loss of lives.
